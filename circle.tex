\chapter{The universal symmetry: the circle}
\label{cha:circle}

An effective principle in mathematics is that when you want to study a certain
phenomenon you should search for a single type that captures this phenomenon.
Here are two examples:\footnote{%
  Notice that these have arrows pointing in different directions:
  In~\cref{it:one-out} we're mapping \emph{out} of $\bn{1}$,
  while in~\cref{it:prop-in} we're mapping \emph{in} to $\Prop$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{it:one-out}
  The contractible type $\bn 1$ has the property that given
any type $A$ a function $\bn 1\to A$ provides exactly the
same information as picking an element in $A$.
For, an equivalence from $A$ to $\bn 1\to A$ is provided by
the function $a \mapsto (x \mapsto a)$.
\item\label{it:prop-in}
  The type $\Prop$ of propositions has the property that
given any type $A$ a function $A\to\Prop$ provides exactly
the same information as picking a subtype of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
We are interested in symmetries, and so we should search for a type $X$
which is so that given \emph{any} type $A$ the type of functions
$X\to A$ (or $A\to X$, but that's not what we're going to do)
picks out exactly the symmetries in $A$.
We will soon see that there is such a type:
the circle\footnote{%
  We call this type the ``circle''
  because it turns out to be the homotopy type of
  the topological circle $\setof{(x,y)\in\RR^2}{x^2+y^2=1}$.
  In the later chapters on geometry we'll return
  to ``real'' geometrical circles.}
which is built \emph{exactly} so that this
``universality with respect to symmetries'' holds.
It may be surprising to see how little it takes to define it;
especially in hindsight when we eventually discover some of the many uses of the circle.

A symmetry in $A$ is an identification $p:a=_Aa$ for some $a:A$.%
\index{symmetry!in a type}
Now, we can take any iteration of $p$ (composing $p$ with itself a number of times),
and we can consider the inverse $p^{-1}$ and \emph{its} iterations.
So, by giving one symmetry we at the same time give a lot of symmetries.
For a particular $p$ it may be that not all of the iterations are different,
for instance it may be that $p^2=p^0\defequi\refl a$ (like in \cref{xca:C2}),
or even more dramatic: if  $p=\refl a$, then \emph{all} the iterates of $p$ are equal.\marginnote{%

However, in general we must be prepared that all the powers of $p$
(positive, $0$ and negative) are distinct.
Hence, the circle must have a distinct symmetry for every integer.
We would have enjoyed defining the integers this way,
but being that ideological would be somewhat inefficient.
Hence we give a more hands-on approach defining the circle
and the integers separately. Thereafter we prove that the type of
symmetries in the circle is equivalent to the set of integers.

\section{The circle and its universal property}
\label{sec:S1}

Propositional truncation from \cref{sec:prop-trunc} was
the first \emph{higher inductive type}, that is, an inductive type
with constructors both for elements and for identifications,
we introduced.
The circle is another example of a higher inductive type,
see Chapter~6 of the HoTT book\footcite{hottbook} for more information.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:circle}
The circle is a type $\Sc:\UU$ with an element (constructor) $\base : \Sc$ and
an identification (constructor) ${\Sloop}: \base=\base$. For convenience and
clarity the (higher) induction principle for $\Sc$ is explained
by first stating a recursion principle for $\Sc$.

Let $A$ be a type. In order to define a function $f:\Sc\to A$,
it suffices to give an element $a$ of $A$ together with an
identification $l$ of type $a=a$. The function $f$ defined
by this data satisfies $f(\base)\jdeq a$ and
the recursion principle provides an (unnamed) element of
$\ap{f}(\Sloop)=l$.

  \caption{The induction principle of $\Sc$.}
  \label{fig:circle-induction}
\end{marginfigure}

Let $A(x)$ be a type for every $x:\Sc$. The induction principle of $\Sc$
states that, in order to prove $A(x)$ for every element $x$ of $\Sc$,
it suffices to give an element $a$ of $A(\base)$ together with an
identification $l$ of type $\pathover{a}{A}{\Sloop}{a}$,
cf.~\cref{fig:circle-induction}.
The function $f$ defined by this data satisfies $f(\base)\jdeq a$ and
the induction principle provides an element of $\apd{f}(\Sloop)=l$.
\end{definition}

Giving $a$ as above is referred to as `the base case', and
giving $l$ as `the loop case'. Given this input data to define
a function $f$ will often be abbreviated by writing
$f(\base)\defeq a$ and $f(\Sloop)\defis l$.

The following result states that any function from the circle exactly
picks out an element and a symmetry of that element.
This is a ``universal property'' of the circle.

\begin{theorem}\label{lem:freeloopspace}
For all types $A$, the evaluation function
\[
\ev_A : (\Sc\to A)\to \sum_{a:A}(a=_Aa)\text{~defined by~}
\ev_A(g)\defeq (g(\base),g(\Sloop))
\]
is an equivalence, with inverse $\ve_A$ defined by the recursion principle.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Fix $A:\UU$. We apply \cref{lem:weq-iso}.
For all $a:A$ and $l:a=a$ we have $\ev(\ve(a,l))=(a,l)$
by the recursion principle. It remains to prove
$\ve(\ev(f))=f$ for all $f:\Sc\to A$. This will follow
from the following more general result. Assume
$p: f(\base)= g(\base)$ and $q: f(\Sloop) = p^{-1}\cdot g(\Sloop)\cdot p$.
We show $f=g$, for which it suffices to prove by circle induction
that $P(x)\defeq(f(x)=g(x))$ for all $x:\Sc$.
For the base case we take $p$.
The loop case reduces to $\trp[P]{\Sloop}(p)=p$ by \cref{def:pathover-trp}.
By \cref{lem:trp-in-fx=Ygx} we have
$\trp[P]{\Sloop}(p)=g(\Sloop)\cdot p \cdot f(\Sloop)^{-1}$.
By $q$ we have $g(\Sloop) = p\cdot f(\Sloop) \cdot p^{-1}$.
Hence $\trp[P]{\Sloop}(p)=p$ by easy calculation.
Using \cref{lem:isEq-pair=} we can phrase the result
as: if $\ev(f)=\ev(g)$, then  $f=g$.

Now we get $\ve(\ev(f))=f$, as
$\ev(\ve(\ev(f)))=(f(\base),f(\Sloop))\jdeq\ev(f)$ with $p\defeq\refl{f(\base)}$
and $q$ coming from the induction principle.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:circle-loopspace}
  For any $a:A$, the function $\ev_A^a:((\Sc,\base)\to_* (A,a))\to (a=_Aa)$
  sending $(g,p)$ to $p^{-1}\cdot g(\Sloop)\cdot p$ is an equivalence.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}\hskip-5pt\footnote{%
    This can also be done directly:
    The inverse to $\ev_A^a$ sends $l : a=_Aa$
    to $(\ve_A(a,l), \refl{a})$.
    Try to verify this!}
It's easy to check commutativity of the diagram
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    (\Sc \to A) \ar[rr,"{g\mapsto(g(\base),g,\refl{g(\base)})}"]
    \ar[dr,"\ev_A"'] & &
    \sum_{a:A}\bigl((\Sc,\base) \ptdto (A,a)\bigr)
    \ar[dl,"\tot(\ev_A^-)"] \\
    &  \,\sum_{a:A}(a=_A a),
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
where the top map is an equivalence by \cref{cor:contract-away},
and the left map is an equivalence by \cref{lem:freeloopspace}.
The result now follows from \cref{lem:fiberwise-equiv-from-tot}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:dep-univ-prop-circle}
By almost the same argument as for \cref{lem:freeloopspace}
one can obtain the dependent universal property of the circle.
Given a type family $A:\Sc\to\UU$, the evaluation function
$(\prod_{x:\Sc} A(x))\to \sum_{a:A(\base)}(\pathover a A {\Sloop} a)$
is an equivalence.

\end{marginfigure}
\begin{remark}
  A function $f:\Sc\to A$ is often called a \emph{loop} in $A$, the
  picture being that $f$ throws $\Sloop:\base=\base$ as a lasso in the
  type $A$.

  Under univalence, so that $a=_Aa$ is identified with the pointed
  functions from the circle, this allows for a very graphic
  interpretation of the symmetries of $a$ in $A$: they are all in the
  image of a function $g$ from the circle: they are loops in the type
  $A$ starting and ending at $a$!\footnote{%
    This is of course how we have been
    picturing loops the whole time.}
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:circleisconnected}
  The circle is connected.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We show $\Trunc{\base=z}$ for all $z:\Sc$ by circle induction
as in \cref{def:circle}.
For the base case we take $\trunc{\refl{\base}}$.
The loop case is immediate as $\Trunc{\base=\base}$ is a proposition.
\end{proof}

In the proof above, the propositional truncation coming
from the definition of connectedness is essential.
If this truncation were removed we wouldn't know what to do in
the induction step (actually, ${\base=z}$ for all $z:\Sc$ contradicts UA).
This said, the family $R:\Sc\to\UU$ with $R(z)\defequi (\base=z)$ is extremely
important for other purposes. We will call it in \cref{def:universalcover} the
``universal \covering'' of the circle and it is the key tool in proving that
the set of integers and the symmetries in the circle coincide. Recall that we
use the phrase ``symmetries \emph{in} the circle'' to refer to the
elements of $\base=_{\Sc}\base$,\footnote{%
  Here we are using ``the circle'' to mean the
  \emph{pointed} type $(\Sc,\base)$.
  But it also turns out that the type $\base=_{\Sc}\base$ is
  equivalent to the type $x=_{\Sc}x$, for any $x:\Sc$.}
whereas we use the phrase ``symmetries \emph{of} the circle'' to refer to the elements of $\Sc=_{\UU}\Sc$.
The latter type is equivalent to $\Sc\amalg\Sc$,
as follows from \cref{xca:S1=S1-components} and \cref{{xca:(S1->S1)_(f)-eqv-S1}}.



In order to do this we should properly define the set of integers
and explore the concept of \coverings.

\section{The integers}
\label{sec:integers}

We define the type of integers in one of the many possible ways.\footnote{%
  Here are some of these alternatives:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item As the copy of $\NN$ where $2n$ means $n$ and $2n+1$ means $-n-1$, for $n:\NN$.
  \item As the sum $\NN\coprod\NN$, where $\inl{n}$ means $-n-1$ and $\inr{n}$ means $n$.
  \item As the sum $\NN\coprod\bn1\coprod\NN$, where from the left copy of $\NN$ we get $-n-1$, from the center $0:\bn1$ we get $0$, and from the right copy of $\NN$ we get $n+1$, for $n:\NN$.
  \item As the quotient of $\NN\times\NN$ under the equivalence relation
    $(n,m) \sim (n',m')$ defined by $n+m' = n'+m$,
    where $(n,m)$ represents $n-m$.
  \item As the subset of $\NN\times\NN$ consisting of those $(n,m)$ with $n=0\lor m=0$ (picking canonical representatives for the above equivalence relation).
  \item As the loops $\base=_\Sc\base$ in the circle. %$\ddot\smile$
  \end{itemize}}

\begin{definition}\label{def:zet}
  Let $\zet$ be the higher inductive type with the following three
  constructors:\glossary(Z){$\protect\zet$}{the set of integers,
  \cref{def:zet}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\iota_+: \NN \to \zet$ for the nonnegative numbers,
  $0,1,\ldots$\glossary(909iota+){$\iota_+$}{embedding of $\NN$ into $\zet$}
\item $\iota_-: \NNN \to \zet$ for the nonpositive numbers,
  $-0,-1,\ldots$\glossary(909iota-){$\iota_-$}{embedding of $\NNN$ into $\zet$}
\item $\zeq : \iota_-(-0) = \iota_+(0)$.
\end{enumerate}
Because we used the copy $\NNN$ for the nonpositive numbers from \cref{exa:nnn},
we can leave out the constructor symbols $\iota_\pm$
when the type is clear from context.
Thus we have $\ldots,-2,-1,-0,0,1,2,\ldots:\zet$ and $\zeq:-0=_\zet0$.

The type $\zet$ comes with an induction principle:
Let $T(z)$ be a family of types indexed by $z:\zet$.
In order to construct an element $f(z)$ of $T(z)$ for all $z:\zet$,
it suffices to give functions $g$ and $h$ such
that $g(n): T(\iota_+(n))$ and $h(n): T(\iota_-(m))$ for all $n:\NN,m:\NNN$,
together with $q : \pathover {h(-0)} T \zeq {g(0)}$.
Here $g$ and $h$ can be defined by induction on $n:\NN,m:\NNN$.\footnote{%
  Of course, giving $h$ is the same as giving $h':\prod_{n:\NN}T(-n)$.}

The resulting function $f:\prod_{z:\zet}T(z)$ satisfies
$f(n)\jdeq g(n)$ and $f(-n)\jdeq h(-n)$ for $n:\NN$,
and there is an (unnamed) element of $\apd{f}(\zeq) = q$.
\end{definition}

Like the type $\NN$, the type $\zet$ is a set with decidable equality
and ordering relations.

One well-known self-equivalence is \emph{negation}, ${-}:\zet\to\zet$,
also called \emph{complement}, inductively defined by setting
$-\iota_+(n)\defeq \iota_-(-n)$,
$-\iota_-(m)\defeq \iota_+(-m)$,
$\constant{ap}_-(\zeq) \defis \inv{\zeq}$.\footnote{%
  Here we included the constructor symbols for clarity,
  but the definition allows us to use the negation symbol
  unadorned, because the following diagram
  commutes (even up to definitional equality):
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large,row sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
      \NN \ar[r,shift left=1mm,"-"]\ar[d,"\iota_+"']
      \& \NNN \ar[l,shift left=1mm,"-"]\ar[d,"\iota_-"] \\
      \zet \ar[r,shift left=1mm,"-"]
      \& \zet \ar[l,shift left=1mm,"-"]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]}
Negation is its own inverse.

The \emph{successor} function $\zs:\zet\to\zet$%
\glossary(s){$\protect\zs$}{successor function on $\zet$} is
likewise defined inductively, setting
$\zs(n) \defeq \Succ(n)$,
$\zs(-0) \defeq 1$,
$\zs(-\Succ(n)) \defeq -n$,
and $\ap{\zs}(\zeq) \defis \refl{1}$.

The successor function $\zs$ is an equivalence.
It is instructive to depict iterating $\zs$ in both directions as
a doubly infinite sequence containing all integers:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[arrows=mapsto,row sep=tiny]
    & & & -0 \ar[dd,eqr]\ar[dr] & & & \\
    \cdots\ar[r] & -2\ar[r] & -1\ar[ur] & & 1\ar[r] & 2\ar[r] & \cdots \\
    & & & 0 \ar[ur] & & &
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

The inverse $\inv\zs$ of $\zs$ is called the \emph{predecessor} function.
We recall the $n$-fold iteration $\zs^n$ defined earlier;
the $n$-fold iteration of $\zs^{-1}$ will be denoted by $\zs^{-n}$.
Since $\zs^0 \jdeq \id \jdeq \zs^{-0}$,
this defines the iteration $\zs^z$ for all $z:\zet$.\footnote{%
  In the same way, we can define the iteration
$f^z : X \to X$ for any \emph{equivalence} $f : X \to X$.}\index{iteration}

\emph{Addition} of integers is now defined by iteration:
$z + y \defeq \zs^{y}(z)$.
This extends $+$ on the $\iota_+$-image of $\NN$,
see \cref{xca:addition-on-Z-and-N}.
From addition and unary $-$ one can define a binary
\emph{subtraction} function setting $z-y \defeq z+(-y)$.
Since addition and subtraction are mutually inverse,
we may iterate addition to define \emph{multiplication}:
$zy \defeq (w \mapsto w+z)^y(0)$.

\begin{xca}\label{xca:addition-on-Z-and-N}
  Show that $\iota_+(n+m)=\iota_+(n)+\iota_+(m)$
  and $\iota_+(nm) =\iota_+(n)\iota_+(m)$ for all $n,m:\NN$.
\end{xca}

The ordering relations $<$ and $\leq$ on $\zet$ are easily defined
and shown to extend those on $\NN$.

Recall the induction principle for $\zet$ in \cref{def:zet} above.
Instead of defining $g$ and $h$ explicitly, we will often
give $f(0)$ directly, and
define $g'$ and $h'$ such that $g'(z): T(z)\to T(z+1)$
for all $z:\zet$ with $z\geq 0$, and $h'(z): T(z)\to T(z-1)$
for all $z:\zet$ with $z\leq 0$. The function $f$ thus defined
satisfies $f(-0) \jdeq f(0)$,
$f(z+1)\jdeq g'(z,f(z))$ for all $z\geq 0$,
and $f(z-1)\jdeq h'(z,f(z))$ for all $z\leq 0$.

\begin{xca}\label{xca:commutative-add-Z}
  Show that $x+y = y+x$ and $xy=yx$ for all $x,y:\zet$.
\end{xca}

\section{\Coverings}
\label{sec:covering}

As mentioned earlier, it is possible to define the integers as the
type $\base=_{\Sc}\base$ of symmetries in the circle.
Our investigation of $\base=_{\Sc}\base$ will use the concept of \coverings.
Since we are going to return to this concept several times,
we take the time for a fuller treatment before we continue with
proving the equivalence of $\base=_{\Sc}\base$ and $\zet$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:covering}
A \emph{\covering} over a type $B$
is a map $f:A\to B$ such that for each $b:B$ the preimage $f^{-1}(b)$ is a set.
We say that a \covering $f:A\to B$ over $B$ is
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{connected}\index{connected \covering} if $A$ is connected,
\item \emph{universal}\index{universal \covering} if $A$ and all
the identity types $a=_Aa$ (for $a:A$) are connected,
\item \emph{finite}\index{finite \covering} if all preimages are finite sets,
\item \emph{decidable}\index{decidable \covering} if all preimages are decidable sets.
\end{itemize}
If $B$ is a pointed type, a \emph{pointed} \covering is a pointed map $f:A\to_*B$ such that, when forgetting the points, $f_\div:A_\div\to B_\div$ is a \covering. Here we only
require $A$ to be a pointed type.\footnote{%
  If we forget the base point of $B$, and the pointedness of $f$, $f_0$,
  then these can be recovered uniquely, by setting $\pt_B \defeq f(\pt_A)$
  and $f_0 \defeq \refl{\pt_B} : \pt_B = f(\pt_A)$.
  Indeed, the forgetful map $\Bigl(\sum_{b:B}(A,a)\ptdto(B,b)\Bigr)
  \to (A \to B)$ is an equivalence by \cref{cor:contract-away}.}
Of course we do get the base point of $A$ in the
preimage of the base point of $B$, but we do not require the preimages of $f_\div$
to be pointed types.
\end{definition}
With a formula, given a type $B$, the type of \coverings over $B$ is
\[
\SetBundle(B) \defeq \sum_{A:\UU}\sum_{f:A\to B}\prod_{b:B}\isset(f^{-1}(b)),
\]
with variations according to the flavor.

Recall the equivalence in \cref{lem:Prop-Set-pointed-families}\ref{lem:Set-families}
between the type $B\to\Set$ of families of sets indexed by $B$, and the type
of \coverings over $B$ given above.
We shall frequently use this equivalence, even without explicit mention.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:setbundle-is-groupoid}
For any type $B$, $\SetBundle(B)$ is a groupoid.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By \cref{lem:Set-is-groupoid} we have that $\Set$ is a groupoid,
and hence $B\to\Set$ is a groupoid by \cref{lem:level-n-utils}\ref{level-n-utils-codom}.
Moreover, by \cref{cor:subtype-same-level}, all variations in \cref{def:covering}
defined by a predicate are groupoids as well.
\end{proof}
One notable exception to the above lemma is the type of \emph{pointed} \coverings:
a point is extra structure, not just a property.

We should notice that the notion of a \covering is just one step up from the notion of an
injection (a map such that all the preimages are propositions --
following the logic, injections perhaps ought to be called ``proposition bundles'').
The formulation we give is not the only one and for some purposes a formulation
based on $B\to\Set$ is more convenient.

\begin{xca}\label{xca:constant-cover}
Let $A,B$ and $C$ be types. Show:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The (unique) map of type $A\to\bn 1$ is a \covering iff $A$ is a set;
\item For any $b:B$, the map $x \mapsto b$ from $\bn 1$ to $B$ is
a \covering iff $b=b$ is a set;
\item If $f: A\to B$ and $g: B\to C$ are \coverings, then $gf$ is a \covering.\endproof
\end{enumerate}
\end{xca}

Figure~\ref{fig:covering} visualizes two examples of \coverings over the circle.
Consider the picture on the left first.
If we let $b$ be the element on the circle marked at the bottom left hand side,
then the preimage $f^{-1}(b)$ is marked by the the two dots in $A$ straight above $b$,
so that in this case each preimage contains two points (is \emph{merely equal} to $\bn 2$).
However, $A$ is not the constant family, like $A'$ depicted on the right, since
$A'=\sum_{z:\Sc}\bn 2=\Sc\times\bn 2=\Sc+\Sc$ is not connected.
Obviously something way more fascinating is going on.
(In fact the \covering on the left is given by $\ve_\UU(\bool,\twist)$,
see \cref{xca:C2} and \cref{lem:freeloopspace}.)

\begin{remark}
  It \emph{is} possible to misunderstand what a ``connected \covering'' is:
the other interpretation ``all the preimages are connected''
would simply give us an equivalence (since connected sets are contractible),
and this is \emph{not} what is intended. (Equivalences are \coverings,
but not necessarily connected \coverings and connected \coverings are not neccesarily equivalences.)

Likewise for the other qualifications; for instance, in a ``finite covering'' $f:A\to B$,
the type $A$ is usually \emph{not} a finite set.

We trust the reader to keep our definitions in mind and not the other interpretations.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
  \Coverings are closely related to a concept from topology called ``covering spaces''
(or any variant of this concept, including Galois theory) and from algebra as locally constant sheaves (of sets).
Either way, the concept is useful because it singles out the (sub)symmetries.
\end{remark}

In this chapter, we focus on \coverings over the circle.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:coveringsofS1perms}
  The evaluation function provides an equivalence
  \[
    \ev_\Set : (\Sc \to \Set) \to \sum_{X:\Set}(X=X)
    \quad\text{defined by $\ev_\Set(E) \defeq (E(\base),E(\Sloop))$.}
  \]
  Consequently, we have a string of equivalences
  \begin{align*}
    \SetBundle(\Sc)
    &\equiv (\Sc \to \Set)
      \equiv \sum_{X:\Set}(X=X) \\
    &\equiv \sum_{X:\Set}(X\equiv X)
    \equiv \sum_{X:\UU}\sum_{f:X\to X}
    \isset(X) \times \isEq(f).
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The first part is the universal property of the circle,
  \cref{lem:freeloopspace}, applied to $A\defeq\Set$.
  The equivalences then follow from \cref{lem:Prop-Set-pointed-families}\ref{lem:Set-families} and UA,
  together with minor manipulations.
\end{proof}
In slogan form: A \covering over the circle is a set with a permutation of its elements.
The fiber over $\base:\Sc$ gives the set,
and transporting along $\Sloop$ gives the permutation.

A particularly important example is the following:
\begin{definition}\label{def:RtoS1}
  The \covering $R:\Sc\to\UU$ corresponds to the integers with the successor operation.
  We have $R(\base)\defeq\zet$ and $R(\Sloop)\defis \etop{\zs}$.
  (Abusing notation we also write $R:\Sc\to\Set$.)
  Now define
  \[
    \tilde R\defeq\sum_{z:\Sc}R(z)
  \]
  and let the first projection denoted by
  \[
    \exp:\tilde R \to \Sc
  \]
  be the \emph{exponential \covering of the circle}.
\end{definition}

  The reason for the name ``exponential'' comes from the following
  visualization.  If $x$ is a real number, then the complex
  exponentiation $e^{2\pi i x}=\cos(2\pi x)+i\sin(2\pi x)$ has
  absolute value $1$ and so defines a continuous function from the
  real numbers to the unit circle.  Choosing any point $z$ on the unit
  circle, we see that the preimage of $z$ under the exponential
  function is a shifted copy of the integers inside the reals.\footnote{%
    Again, we emphasize that we are here dealing with the
    \emph{homotopy types} of the reals $\RR$ and the unit circle,
    $\setof{(x,y):\RR^2}{x^2+y^2=1}$.}

  This connection between the integers and the unit circle is
  precisely captured in a form that we can take further by studying the
  \covering $\exp:\tilde R\to \Sc$.
\end{remark}

We already defined a \covering $f:A\to B$ to be universal if $A$ is connected
and all $a=_A a$ (for $a:A$) are connected.
If moreover $B$ is a pointed, connected groupoid we shall argue that
we actually can speak of \emph{the} universal \covering.

Recall \cref{cor:fib-vs-path} stating that all the fibers of a map $f:A\to B$
are sets if and only if each
\[
\ap{f}: (a=a')\to (f(a)=f(a'))
\]
is an injection.
Assume $f:A\to B$ is a universal \covering and $B$ is a groupoid.
We prove that $A$ is contractible.
Being contractible is a proposition, so we may assume
we have an element $a$ of $A$ since $A$ is connected.
By \cref{xca:connected-trivia} and \ref{xca:component-connected}
it suffices to prove that $a=a$ is contractible.
By \cref{xca:prop-set-trivia}, using that $a=a$ is connected,
it suffices to show that $a=a$ is a set.
Using that $\ap{f}$ is an injection, we can apply the remark after
\cref{lem:sum-of-fibers} and obtain that $a=a$ is a set since
$f(a)=f(a)$ is a set, since $B$ is a groupoid.
This completes the proof that $A$ is contractible.

Now assume $(B,b_0)$ is a pointed connected groupoid and $f:A\to B$
a universal \covering. Since $A$ and $\sum_{b:B}(b_0=_Bb)$ are both
contractible, and $B$ is connected, we have
$\Trunc{(A,f)=(\sum_{b:B}(b_0=_Bb),\fst)}$.
Hence if $(B,b_0)$ is a pointed connected groupoid, all
universal \coverings are merely equal to a canonical one.
Moreover, the type of universal \coverings is equivalent to
$\bn 1 \to B$, and hence to $B$ itself,
so the type of \emph{pointed} universal \coverings is contractible.
This justifies the following definition.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:universalcover}
  Let $(B,b_0)$ be a pointed connected groupoid.
  The \emph{universal \covering} of $B$
  is the \covering of $B$ given by the family of sets
  \[
    \uc{b_0}:B\to\Set,\quad \uc{b_0}(b)\defequi (b_0=_Bb),
  \]
  or alternatively as the first projection from
  $\uc{b_0}B\defequi\sum_{b:B}(b_0=_Bb)$ to $B$.

  This is canonically pointed at $(b_0,\refl{b_0}) : \sum_{b:B}(b_0=_Bb)$.
\end{definition}
Note that $(b_0=_B b)$ is a family of \emph{sets} exactly when $B$ is a groupoid.
The type family $(b_0=_B b)$ is also important if $B$ is not a groupoid,
but is then not a \emph{set} bundle.\footnote{%
  Of course, the type $\sum_{b:B}(b_0=b)$ is contractibe
  by \cref{lem:thepathspaceiscontractible}, for any type $B$.}

\begin{remark}
  What's so ``universal'' about this?
The universal \covering over the pointed connected groupoid $(B,b_0)$ coincides with the constant function $\cst{b_0}:\bn 1\to B$ (with value $b_0$), and seems like an unnecessary complicated representation were it not for the manifold practical value of the formulation that we've given.
In particular, we recognize the set of symmetries $b_0=_Bb_0$ as the preimage of $b_0$ under the first projection from $\uc{b_0}B$ to $B$; ultimately this will show that the study of symmetries coincides with the study of the universal \covering.

The first instance of this comes already in the next section, where we show in \cref{cor:S1groupoid} that the symmetries in the circle are given by the set of integers $\zet$ by showing that the universal \covering and the exponential \covering (\cref{def:RtoS1}) of the circle coincide.

That said, one way to see that the constant function $\cst{b_0}:\bn 1\to B$
\emph{does} deserve the label universal is the following.\marginnote{%
  Any $(a_0,p) : f^{-1}(b_0)$ gives rise to a commutative diagram:
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small,ampersand replacement=\&]
      \bn 1\ar[rr,dashed,"\cst{a_0}"]\ar[dr,"\cst{b_0}"'] \& \& A \ar[dl,"f"] \\
      \& B \&
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]}
Given any function $f:A\to B$ and $(a_0,p): f^{-1}(b_0)$,
we get a function $\cst{a_0}:\bn 1\to A$, and $p:b_0=f(a_0)$ gives rise to
an element in $\cst{b_0}=_{\bn 1\to B}f \circ \cst{a_0}$.
In other words, any such $f$ is ``a factor of $\cst{b_0}$''.
Note, however, that this depends on $f^{-1}(b_0)$ being non-empty
(classically, this is often demanded of a covering, which distinguishes it from our \coverings),
and the factorization depends on the element $(a_0,p)$ used.

The situation is even simpler for pointed \coverings:
For any \emph{pointed} \covering $f : A \ptdto B$, with $(a_0,f_0):f^{-1}(b_0)$,
there is a \emph{unique} pointed map $g : \bn 1 \ptdto A$
(given by the base point of $A$), and this of course also gives
the unique way to write $f$ as a ``pointed factor of $\cst{b_0}$''.
\end{remark}

We'll continue the general study of set bundles in \cref{sec:gsets}
and indeed throughout the book.
For now, we'll focus our attention on the circle and set bundles over it.

\section{The symmetries in the circle}
\label{sec:symcirc}

With the set $\zet$ of integers \emph{defined} as in \cref{sec:integers},
we will now \emph{prove} that $\zet$ is equivalent to the type
$\base=_{\Sc}\base$, and that under this equivalence $0:\zet$ corresponds to
$\refl{\base}:\base=\base$, and $1$ to $\Sloop$, and $-1$ to $\Sloop^{-1}$.
More generally, the successor $\zs:\zet\to\zet$ corresponds to composition with $\Sloop$,
while the predecessor $\inv{\zs}$ corresponds to composition with $\Sloop^{-1}$.\marginnote{
  It follows directly that \emph{addition} of integers corresponds
  to \emph{composition} of loops.}

The first step is to prove that the exponential \covering \cref{def:RtoS1}
is equal to the universal \covering in \cref{def:universalcover},
\ie we prove that the family
\[
  R: \Sc\to\UU,\qquad R(\base)\defeq\zet,\, R(\Sloop)\defis \etop{\zs}
\]
is equal to the family
\[
\uc{\base}:\Sc\to\UU,\qquad \uc{\base}(z)\defeq (\base=z).
\]
What does it mean for the families $\uc{\base}$ and $R$ to be equal?
Type families are a special case of functions.
Function extensionality reduces the question to pointwise equality
of $\uc{\base}$ and $R$ as functions.
Using univalence, it suffices to give
an equivalence from $\uc{\base}(z)$ to $R(z)$ for every $z:\Sc$,
that is, recalling \cref{def:function-type-families}
an equivalence $f: \uc{\base}\to R$. We will use
\cref{lem:weq-iso}, so will also define $g: R\to\uc{\base}$.

We first recall from \cref{sec:heavy-transport} how
transport behaves in families of function types.
Given a type $A$ and two type families $P,Q:A\to\UU$,
transport along $p:a=_Aa'$ of $h:P(a)\to Q(a)$ is
$Q(p)\,h\,P(p)^{-1}:P(a') \to Q(a')$.
In a picture,
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=huge]
    a\ar[d,eqr,"p"] & P(a)\ar[r,"h"]\ar[d,eqr,"P(p)"] &
    Q(a)\ar[d,eqr,"Q(p)"] \\
    a' & P(a') & \,Q(a').
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
If $A$ is $\Sc$, then the induction principle for the circle says
that giving an $h(z):P(z)\to Q(z)$ for all $z:\Sc$ is the same as
specifying an $h(\base):P(\base)\to Q(\base)$ and an identity
$h(\Sloop):Q(\Sloop)\,h(\base)\,P(\Sloop)^{-1}=_{P(\base)\to Q(\base)}h(\base)$,
\ie   a witness that the composites in
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=huge]
    P(\base)\ar[r,"h(\base)"]\ar[d,eqr,"P(\Sloop)"]
    & Q(\base)\ar[d,eqr,"Q(\Sloop)"] \\
    P(\base)\ar[r,"h(\base)"] & Q(\base)
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
are equal. If $P,Q$ are families of sets,
then the type of $h(\Sloop)$ is a proposition.

We now define $f: \uc{\base}\to R$ and $g: R\to\uc{\base}$ that will turn out to
give inverse equivalences between $\uc{\base}(z)$ and $R(z)$, for each $z:\Sc$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:windingnumber}
For $f$ as in \cref{def:fPtoR} we have $f(\base)(\Sloop^n)=n$ for all $n:\zet$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
First consider positive $n:\NN$ and apply induction. In the base case $n=0$ we have
$f(\base)(\Sloop^0)\jdeq f(\refl\base)\jdeq\trp[R]{\refl\base}(0) \jdeq 0$.
For $n=\zs(m)$ with $m:\NN$ we have
\begin{align*}
  f(\base)(\Sloop^{\zs(m)})
  &\jdeq\trp[R]{\Sloop^{\zs(m)}}(0)\\
  &=\trp[R]{\Sloop \Sloop^{m}}(0)\\
  &=\trp[R]{\Sloop}(\trp[R]{\Sloop^m}(0))\\
  &\jdeq \trp[R]{\Sloop}(f(\base)(\Sloop^{m}))\\
  &= \zs(f(\base)(\Sloop^{m})).
\end{align*}
The last step follows from $\etop{\zs}=R(\Sloop)$
and $\zs=\trp[\id_\UU]{\etop{\zs}}$, see \cref{def:univalence},
and hence $\zs=\trp[\id_\UU]{R(\Sloop)}=\trp[\id_\UU R]{\Sloop}=\trp[R]{\Sloop}$.
This completes the induction step for positive $n$.
For negative $n$ the proof is similar.
\end{proof}

In the definition of the second map,
take into account that $R(\base)\jdeq \zet$ and $\uc{\base}(\base) \jdeq (\base=\base)$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:gRtoP}
The function $g:\prod_{z:\Sc}(R(z)\to \uc{\base}(z))$ is
defined by circle induction:
\[
g(\base)\defeq \left(n \mapsto {\Sloop^n} \right) :\zet\to(\base=\base)
\]
and
\[
g(\Sloop): \uc{\base}(\Sloop)\, g(\base)\,R(\Sloop)^{-1}=_{\zet\to (\base=\base)} g(\base).
\]
\marginnote{%
  In a picture, $g(\Sloop)$ should prove that it does not matter what
  path you take around the square
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=huge,ampersand replacement=\&]
      \zet\ar[r,"\Sloop^-"]\ar[d,eqr,"\zs"] \&

      \zet\ar[r,"\Sloop^-"] \& (\base=\base).
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
}%
So far we have only given the type of $g(\Sloop)$. By definition,
$R(\Sloop)$ is $\zs$ and $\uc{\base}(\Sloop)$ is composition with
$\Sloop$.%
The element $g(\Sloop)$ follows by a simple calculation: the
proposition ${\Sloop\,\Sloop^{n-1}} = {\Sloop^n}$ holds for all
$n:\zet$.
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}
  \label{lem:univisexp}
For every $z:\Sc$, the functions $f(z)$ defined in \cref{def:fPtoR}
and $g(z)$ in \cref{def:gRtoP} are inverse equivalences between
$\uc{\base}(z)$ and $R(z)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We apply \cref{lem:weq-iso} and verify the two conditions.
  First, we need to give elements $H(z,p):g(z)(f(z)(p))=p$
for all $z:\Sc$ and $p:\uc{\base}(z)\jdeq(\base=z)$.
By induction on $p:\base=z$ it suffices to set
$H(\base,\refl\base)\defeq\refl{\refl{\base}}$ since
$g(\base)(f(\base)(\refl{\base}))\jdeq g(\base)(0)\jdeq\refl{\base}$.

Secondly, we need to give elements $G(z)(n):f(z)(g(z)(n))=n$
for all $z:\Sc$ and $n: R(z)$.
By circle induction it suffices to define $G(\base)$ and $G(\Sloop)$,
but since $\zet$ is a set the information for $G(\Sloop)$ is redundant.
Hence, we need to show that for all $n:\zet$ that
$f(\base)(g(\base)(n))\jdeq  f(\base)(\Sloop^n)$ is equal to $n$.
This follows from \cref{lem:windingnumber}.
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}\label{cor:S1groupoid}
The circle $\Sc$ is a groupoid, and the function
\[
{\Sloop}^{\blank} : \zet\to(\base=_{\Sc}\base)
\]
sending $n$ to $\Sloop^n$ is an equivalence.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
For any $z:\Sc$, the type $\uc{\base}(z)\jdeq (\base=_{\Sc}z)$ is a set
since $R(z)$ is a set and $\uc{\base}(z) \equiv R(z)$.
Since the circle is connected and being a set is a proposition, it follows
that $y=_{\Sc}z$ is a set, for any $y,z:\Sc$. Hence $\Sc$ is a groupoid.
By \cref{def:gRtoP}, ${\Sloop}^{-}\jdeq g(\base)$ is an equivalence.
\end{proof}

The following lemma is a simple example of a technique later called \emph{delooping}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:S1-delooping}
Let $A$ be a connected type and $a:A$.
Assume we have an equivalence $e:(\base=_{\Sc}\base) \to (a=a)$
of symmetries such that $e(\refl{\base})=\refl{a}$
and $e(p\cdot q)=e(p)\cdot e(q)$, for all $p,q:(\base=_{\Sc}\base)$.
Then $\check e : \Sc\to A$ defined by circle recursion by setting
$\check e(\base)\defeq a$ and $\check e(\Sloop)\defis e(\Sloop)$
is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We have $\ap{\check e} = e$ since they produce equal values when applied
to $\Sloop^n$, for all $n:\zet$. Now use that $A$ and $\Sc$ are connected and
apply \cref{cor:fib-vs-path}\ref{conn-fib-vs-path}.
\end{proof}

\section{A reinterpretation of the circle}\label{sec:S1isC}

In this section we return to the equivalences in \cref{thm:coveringsofS1perms}.
We'll use these to get a different perspective on the circle,
which highlights it as a type classifying very simple symmetries,
namely sets with permutations.
We have already seen one example in \cref{def:RtoS1},
namely the set $\zet$ of integers together with the successor $\zs: \zet\equiv\zet$,
corresponding to the universal \covering $\uc\base:\Sc \to \Set$,
which as a map is the constant function $\cst\base : \bn 1 \to \Sc$.

The importance of the latter example will become apparent when we eventually
explain that \emph{the circle is equivalent to the connected component of
  $(\zet,\zs)$ in the type $\sum_{X:\UU}(X\to X)$}.\footnote{%
  The elements of this connected component can be thought of as
  \emph{infinite cyclic sets}:
  sets $X$ with a successor function $f:X \to X$
  such that $(X,f)$ is merely equal to $(\zet,\zs)$.
  That is, $(X,f)$ looks exactly like $(\zet,\zs)$,
  but we don't know which element of $X$ is ``zero'':\\[1ex]
  \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=10pt]
    \begin{scope}[every node/.style={dot}]
      \node (x1) {};
      \foreach \p/\n/\deg in {1/2/27, 2/3/54, 3/4/81, 4/5/108, 5/6/135,%
        6/7/162, 7/8/135, 8/9/108, 9/10/81, 10/11/54, 11/12/27} {
        \node (x\n) [at=(x\p.\deg), anchor=\deg+180, shift=(\deg:10pt)] {};
      }
    \end{scope}
    \node (x0) [left=of x1] {$\ldots$};
    \node (x13) [right=of x12] {$\ldots$};
    \begin{scope}[->,shorten <=1pt,shorten >=1pt]

        6/7, 7/8, 8/9, 9/10, 10/11, 11/12, 12/13} {
        \draw (x\p)--(x\n);
      }
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}}

The key of course is that the equivalences in \cref{thm:coveringsofS1perms}
restrict to equivalences between their connected components,
so to understand the components of $\SetBundle(\Sc)$
it suffices to understand the components of $\sum_{X:\UU}(X \to X)$ at pairs $(X,f)$,
where $X$ is a set with a permutation $f$.

We are particularly interested in understanding the symmetries in these components,
so before we prove that the circle is equivalent to the component containing $(\zet,\zs$),
let us investigate the equalities in the type $\sum_{X:\UU}(X \to X)$ a bit further.

Define the type family $D$ by $D(X) \defeq (X\to X)$ for all $X:\UU$.
Recall from \cref{lem:isEq-pair=} that, given $X,Y:\UU$ and $f:X\to X$ and $g:Y\to Y$,
the identity type $(X,f)=(Y,g)$
is equivalent to the type of pairs consisting of a $p:X=Y$ and
an element of $\pathover{f}{D}{p}{g}$. The latter type is
equivalent to $\trp[D]{p}(f) = g$ by \cref{def:pathover-trp}.
The transport is by conjugation,
\cref{lem:trp-in-function-type}, so that the latter
type is equivalent to $\ptoe p\circ f\circ \ptoe p^{-1} = g$.
If $p\jdeq\etop e$ for an equivalence $e:X\equiv Y$,
this is equivalent to $e\circ f = g\circ e$, or $e f = g e$ for short.
In total, the identity type $(X,f)=(Y,g)$ is equivalent to
\[
  \sum_{e: X\equiv Y} ef =_{X\to Y} ge.
\]
This is a set whenever $X$ and $Y$ are; see \cref{fig:Zs=Xf} for an illustration.

  \caption{An identification of two infinite cyclic sets.
    The equivalence $e : \zet \equiv X$ is marked in blue.}\label{fig:Zs=Xf}
\end{marginfigure}
In particular, the identity type $(\zet,\zs)=(X,f)$
is equivalent to the set $\sum_{e:\zet\equiv\zet}e\zs=fe$, for any set $X$ with a permutation $f$.
Tautologically, then, any power $\zs^n$ of $\zs$ itself gives a symmetry
$(\zs^n,!) : (\zet,\zs)=(\zet,\zs)$.

The following property jumps out at us when we contemplate~\cref{fig:Zs=Xf}.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:IdCisZet}
  An element $(e,!) : (\zet,\zs)=(X,f)$, with $(X,f)$ in the component of $(\zet,\zs)$,
  is uniquely determined by the element $e(0):X$.
  In other words, the function
  \[
    \ev_0:\bigl((\zet,\zs)=(X,f)\bigr)\to X
    \text{~~defined by~~} \ev_0(e,!) \defeq e(0)
  \]
  is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Given $x_0:X$ we must determine a unique equivalence $e:\zet\to X$
  such that $es=fe$ and $e(0)=x_0$.
  Induction on $n:\zet$ (positive and negative $n$ separately)
  gives that $e(n)=f^n(e(0))$.
  Now we need to prove that this $e$ is an equivalence.
  Since we're proving an equivalence, and we're assuming $(X,f)$ is in the component
  of $(\zet,\zs)$, it suffices to show this for $(X,f)\jdeq(\zet,\zs)$.
  However, for any $x_0:\zet$,
  the map $n \mapsto \zs^n(x_0) = n + x_0$ is an equivalence,
  with inverse $n \mapsto n - x_0$.
\end{proof}
In particular, the identity type $(\zet,\zs)=(\zet,\zs)$ is equivalent to $\zet$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:S1toC}
  Let $\InfCycSet$ be the component of $\sum_{X:\UU}(X\to X)$ containing $(\zet,\zs)$.
  Elements of $\InfCycSet$ are called \emph{infinite cyclic sets}.

  Define by circle induction
  \[
    c:\Sc\to\InfCycSet \text{~~setting~~}
    c(\base)\defequi (\zet,\zs)
  \]
  and $c(\Sloop): c(\base)= c(\base)$ given by the \emph{predecessor} equivalence
  $\zs^{-1}:\zet\to\zet$
  and the trivial proof of the proposition $\zs^{-1}\zs=\zs\zs^{-1}$.
\end{definition}

Note that, as usual, we leave out the propositional components of $\FinCycSet$ (and other subtypes) from the notation.

Since it's such a crucial result, we are going to give two proofs that $c$ from \cref{def:S1toC} is an equivalence.
Each proof illuminates a different aspect and gives methods that will be used later.

For the first, we return to the equivalences of \cref{thm:coveringsofS1perms}.
As we said above, these restrict to equivalences between the different components.
We claim that we get a commuting diagram
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setbundle-Sc-univ-comp}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    & \Sc\ar[dl,"\cst{\blank}"']\ar[d,"\uc{\blank}"]\ar[dr,"c"] & \\
    \conncomp{\SetBundle(\Sc)}{\cst\base} \ar[r,"\sim"]
    & \conncomp{(\Sc\to\UU)}{\uc\base} \ar[r,"\sim","\ev_\UU"']
    & \InfCycSet,
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
where the left-most diagonal arrow maps $z:\Sc$ to the constant map $\cst z:\bn 1\to\Sc$.
The left-hand triangle commutes, because the fiber of $\cst z$ at $x:\Sc$
is equivalent to $\uc{z}(x) \jdeq (z=x)$.
We prove that the right-hand triangle commutes by circle induction.
That is, we show $\prod_{z:\Sc}c(z) = \ev_\UU(\uc{z})$.
The case $z\jdeq\base$ is exactly the equivalence
$g(\base) = \Sloop^- : \zet \to \uc{\base}(\base)$ of \cref{lem:univisexp}
together with the fact that $\trp[\uc\base]{\Sloop}$ corresponds to $\zs$.
To finish, we observe that it doesn't matter which way you take in the diagram
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=huge]
    \zet\ar[r,"\Sloop^-"]\ar[d,"\inv{\zs}"] &
    (\base=\base)\ar[d,"\blank\cdot\Sloop^{-1}"] \\
    \zet\ar[r,"\Sloop^-"] & (\base=\base).
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
Note that to transport in the family $\uc{-}(\base) \jdeq (\blank = \base)$,
we use \cref{xca:trp-in-a/x=b/x}\ref{trp-in-x=a},
and \emph{that} is why we picked the predecessor equivalence in~\cref{def:S1toC}.

With~\eqref{eq:setbundle-Sc-univ-comp} in hand, we see that $c$ is an equivalence
if and only if either of the two other downward maps are.\footnote{%
  At this point we could conclude with an appeal to the type theoretic Yoneda lemma,
  which states that the map $X \to (X \to \UU)$,
  sending $x$ to the family $y \mapsto x=y$,
  is an injection for any type $X$.
  Exercise: Prove this!}
It is very direct to show that the map on the left is an equivalence.
Indeed, the identity type $(\bn 1,\cst x)=(\bn 1,\cst y)$
is equivalent to pairs of an equivalence $e : \bn 1 \to \bn 1$ and a commuting triangle
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \bn 1 \ar[rr,"e"]\ar[dr,"\cst x"'] & & \bn 1\ar[dl,"\cst y"] \\
    & \Sc. &
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
But since $\bn 1$ is contractible, this just amounts to the equality $x=y$.
Hence the map is an embedding, and we conclude by \cref{cor:fib-vs-path}\ref{conn-fib-vs-path}.

We now give the second, more direct, proof that $c$ is an equivalence.
For this we use the following lemma, which is of independent interest.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:conn-eq-f-ap-f-x}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be connected types, $x$ an element of $X$,
and $f$ a function from $X$ to $Y$. Then $f$ is an equivalence
if and only if $\ap{f}: (x=x) \to (f(x)=f(x))$ is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Using \cref{cor:fib-vs-path}\ref{conn-fib-vs-path} it suffices to show that
each $\ap{f}$ is an equivalence if and only if the specific $\ap{f}$ with
domain $x=x$ is an equivalence. Being an equivalence is a proposition,
so this follows in two easy steps from $X$ being connected,
using \cref{xca:component-connected}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:S1bysymmetries}
  The function $c:\Sc\to\InfCycSet$ from \cref{def:S1toC} is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  In view of \cref{lem:conn-eq-f-ap-f-x} we only need to show that
$\ap{c}:(\base=_{\Sc}\base)\to((\zet,\zs)=(\zet,\zs))$ is an equivalence.
Note that both the domain and the co-domain of $\ap{c}$ are equivalent to $\zet$.
Consider the following diagram in which we compose $c$ with the equivalences
from \cref{cor:S1groupoid} and \cref{lem:IdCisZet}:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
    \zet\ar[r,"\Sloop^-"] &
    (\base=\base)\ar[r,"\ap{c}"] &
    \bigl((\zet,\zs)=(\zet,\zs)\bigr)\ar[r,"\ev_0\vphantom{\ap{c}}"] &
    \zet
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
For $c$ to be an equivalence, it suffices to show that the composition
is an equivalence $\zet$.
By definition, $\ap{c}(\Sloop)$ is the identification
corresponding to $\inv\zs$, sending $0$ to $-1$,
and by induction on $n:\zet$ it follows that
$\ev_0(\ap{c}(\Sloop^n)) = \zs^{-n}(0) = -n$.
And the map $n \mapsto -n$ is indeed an equivalence.
\end{proof}

\section{Other \coverings over the circle}
\label{sec:covS1}

Let $A$ be a type and $f:A\to \Sc$ a function.
By \cref{cor:fib-vs-path}\ref{set-fib-vs-path}, $f$ is a \covering
over $\Sc$ if and only if each $\ap{f}$ is injective.
Assume that $f:A\to \Sc$ is a \covering with $A$ is connected.
Let $(a_0,p)$ be an element of $f^{-1}(\base)$.
By \cref{xca:component-connected}
the condition that \emph{each} $\ap{f}$ is injective
can be relaxed to $\ap{f}: (a_0=a_0)\to(f(a_0)=f(a_0))$ being injective.
Now look at the following subset:
\[
\set{~ l: \base = \base \mid {\ap{f}}^{-1}(plp^{-1})~ }.
\]
Clearly, a classification of connected \coverings over the circle
also classifies certain subsets of symmetries of $\base$.
Such subsets are closed under concatenation and inverses,
since $\ap{f}$ is compatible with these operations,
see \cref{lem:apcomp}.
Using language yet to be introduced, we actually ``classify the subgroups of the integers''.

We start by giving some examples of connected \coverings of the circle.
In the course of our discussion, we will see that -- assuming a weak form
of the Law of the Excluded Middle -- these are all the decidable connected
\coverings over the circle.

\begin{example}\label{exa:univS1cover}
The \emph{universal} \covering from \cref{def:universalcover}
is the map $\cst\base:\bn 1\to \Sc$
sending the unique element of $\bn 1$ to $\base$.
(It takes this simple form since the circle is a pointed connected
groupoid, see the discussion before \cref{def:universalcover}.)
The universal \covering corresponds to the subset consisting
of $\refl\base : \base=\base$ only.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{exa:mfoldS1cover}
For $m:\NN$ positive, define the \emph{degree $m$ function} by circle induction
\[
\dg{m}:\Sc\to \Sc, \text{~~setting~}
\dg{m}(\base)\defeq\base \text{~~and~}
\dg{m}(\Sloop)\defis{\Sloop}^m.
\]
This \covering corresponds to the subset consisting
of ${\Sloop}^{mn} : \base=\base$ for all $n:\zet$.
\end{example}

Note that the degree $0$ function would be constant,
and hence not a \covering since the domain is not a set,
see \cref{xca:constant-cover}.

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:RtoS1}
The universal \covering is essentially the same as defined in \cref{def:RtoS1}
and explained in \cref{rem:expforreal}
since the real numbers form a contractible space.

\label{rem:finitecoveringsofS1}
The analogue of our degree $m$ function is the $m$-th power of complex numbers
restricted to the unit circle, mapping $z$ to $z^m$ if $|z|=1$.
The following visualization is perhaps more tangible.
Let $m=12$ and picture the circle and mark $12$ evenly spaced points.
This will look like a clock, with marks $1,2,\dots,12$.
You can then make a function from the circle to itself by sending
all marks to $12$ and each of the arcs connecting the marks to the entire circle
-- (in a continuous manner preserving the orientation).\qedhere%

We could be more ambitious and ask: what is the \emph{type} of decidable
\coverings over the circle?  Since the type of \coverings is
equivalent to $\Sc\to \Set$, and $\Set$ is a groupoid
(\cref{lem:Set-is-groupoid}),
\cref{lem:level-n-utils}\ref{level-n-utils-codom} gives
that the type of decidable \coverings over the circle is a groupoid.
We will pin this groupoid down by first identifying the components
(of which there turns out to be one for each natural number),
and then analyzing one component at a time.

Recall the function $c:\Sc\to C$ of \cref{def:S1toC}.
By \cref{thm:S1bysymmetries} we know that $c$ is an equivalence,
so classifying \coverings over $\Sc$ is equivalent to
classifying \coverings over $C$.
We simplify the notation slightly, letting $\pt_C\defeq(\zet,\etop{s}):C$
(so that $\pt_C \jdeq c(\base)$ with $c$ from \cref{def:S1toC}),
and allowing ourselves to write $s:\pt_C=_C\pt_C$ instead of the
more honest $\pathpair{\etop{s}}{!}:\pt_C=_C\pt_C$
(equal to the $c$-image of ${\Sloop}:\base=\base$).

It is instructive to rephrase the examples of connected \coverings over $\Sc$ in
terms of $C$, even though they could be transported along the identity $\bar c:\Sc=C$ corresponding to $c$.

\begin{example}\label{exa:univCcover}
The universal \covering is represented by the constant function
$\cst{(\zet,\etop{s})}:\bn 1\to C$ sending the unique element
of $\bn 1$ to $(\zet,\etop{s}):C$.\footnote{%
  In light of \cref{ft:Ztor-equiv} we see that the fiber
  of this universal covering over $(X,i):C$ is $X$ itself%
  ---that's certainly a universal set associated to the
  infinite cyclic set $(X,i)$!}
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{exa:mfoldCcover}
Assume that $m:\NN$ is positive.  We now give a description of
the $m$-fold \covering over the circle in terms of $C$.

We proceed as follows.
First we present the answer, a \covering we call $\cdg{m}:C\to C$,
and then we prove that $\dg{m}:\Sc\to\Sc$ and $\cdg{m}:C\to C$
correspond to each other under the equivalence $c:\Sc\we C$.

What should we require of $\cdg{m}(X,i)$ for $(X,i):C$?
Well, $\dg{m}:\Sc\to\Sc$ sends $\base$ to $\base$ and $\Sloop$ to $\Sloop^m$;
somehow only the $\Sloop^k$ where $k$ is a multiple of $k$ is in the image of $\dg{m}$.
So we have to find an element $(Y,j):C$ with ``$j^m$ corresponding to $i$''.
We achieve this by ``streching'' $X$:
Let $Y$ be $m$ copies of $X$ and let $j$ jump idly from one copy to another except every $m$-th time when $j$ also is allowed to use $i$.
This is illustrated in \cref{fig:root} with the shift by $f\defeq\ptoe{i}$ being
vertical and the movement from copy to copy going around a circle.

\begin{construction}\label{con:root}
  For any type $X$ and $f:X\to X$, we define the $m$-th \emph{root}
  \[
    {\textstyle\sqrt[m]f} : {\bn m\times X} \to {\bn m\times X}.
  \]
\end{construction}
\begin{implementation}{con:root}
  We set
  \[
    {\textstyle\sqrt[m]f}(k,x)\defeq
    \begin{cases}
      (k+1,x)& \text{for $k<m-1$ and}\\
      (0,f(x))& \text{for $k=m-1$}.\qedhere
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{implementation}
Only one $m$-th of the time does $\sqrt[m]f$ use $f:X\to X$,
the rest of the time it increases the element in $\bn m$).
Indeed, iterating $\sqrt[m]f$ we get $(\sqrt[m]f)^m(k,x)=(k,f(x))$;
hence the term ``$m$-th root'' is apt.

If $f$ is an equivalence, then so is $\sqrt[m]f$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item On one hand, an element in  $(\sqrt[m]f)(\ell,y) = (0,x)$ consists
of the assertion that  $\ell=m-1$ and an element in $f(y)=x$,
so  $(\sqrt[m]f)^{-1}(0,x)$ is equivalent
to $f^{-1}(x)$, which is contractible if $f$ is an equivalence.
\item On the other, if $k:\bn m$ is not $0$, then
 an element in $(\sqrt[m]f)(\ell,y)=(k,x)$
 consists of the assertion that $\ell+1=k$ and an element in $y=x$, and so
$(\sqrt[m]f)^{-1}(k,x)$ is equivalent to the contractible type $\sum_{y:X}y=x$.
\end{enumerate}

Using univalence, the $m$-th root construction applies not only to equivalences,
but equally well to identities $i:X=X$,
writing $\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{i} \defeq \overetop{\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{\ptoe{i}}}$,
resulting in a function
\[
  \cdg{m}:\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X)\to\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X),\quad
  \cdg{m}(X,i) \defeq \bigl(\bn m\times X, \textstyle\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{i}\bigr).
\]
We now focus on  $C$, the component of $\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X)$ containing $(\zet,\etop{s})$.
Note\marginnote{%
  In terms of iterated addition, we have
  $\varphi(k,n) = (z \mapsto z+m)^n(k)$.}
that the function $\varphi : (\bn m\times \zet) \to \zet$
given by $\varphi(k,n)=k+mn$ is an equivalence.
Moreover, we have ${\varphi\!\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s} = {s\varphi}$, since
\[
  \varphi\bigl(\!\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s(k,n)\bigr)
  = k+1+mn = s(\varphi(k,n))
  \quad\text{for all $(k,n):\bn m\times \zet$}.
\]
Hence $\cdg{m}(\zet,\etop{s}) \jdeq (\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{\etop{s}}) = (\zet,\etop{s})$.
If $(\zet,\etop{s})=(X,f)$, then $\cdg{m}(\zet,\etop{s})=\cdg{m}(X,f)$,
so $(\zet,\etop{s})=\cdg{m}(X,f)$. Hence we can actually restrict the
\emph{degree $m$ function} to the component $C$:
\[
  \cdg{m}:C\to C,\qquad
  \cdg{m}(X,i)\defeq(\bn m\times X,{\textstyle\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]i}).
\]
We use $\rho$ for ``root'' to denote this incarnation
of the degree $m$ function.\footnote{%
  \label{ft:infinite-cyclic-modulo}%
  The fiber of $\cdg{m}$ at an infinite cyclic set $(X,i)$ is the set
  $X/m \defeq X/\sim_m$ where $\sim_m$ is the equivalence relation that
  identifies points that are a distance $mn$ apart, for some $n:\zet$.
  Indeed, the fiber is
  \[
    \sum_{(Y,j):C}\bigl((X,i) = (\bn m\times Y, \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{j})\bigr).
  \]
  The equivalence is obtained by sending an equivalence class $Y$ to
  the corresponding infinite cyclic set $(Y,i^m)$ together with the
  natural identification $(X,i) = (\bn m\times Y, \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{i^m})$.

  The reader will no doubt have noticed that $X/m$ is a \emph{finite cyclic} set.
  We'll return to the significance of this below.}

We now analyze how $\cdg{m}$ acts on paths.
Let $\pathpair{\etop{p}}{!}:(X,f)=_C(X',f')$.
Since $\cdg{m}$ maps first components $X$ to $\bn m\times X$, we get that
the first projection of $\ap{\cdg{m}}\pathpair{\etop{p}}{!}$ is
$\overetop{\id\times p} : (\bn m\times X) = (\bn m\times X')$.
We are particularly interested in the case of the loop of $C$,
that is, $\pathpair{\etop{s}}{!}:(\zet,\etop{s})=_C(\zet,\etop{s})$.
We calculate $(\id\times s)(k,n) = (k,s(n))$,
which by the property of the $m$-root is equal to $(\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s)^m(k,n)$.
So we have $(\id\times s)=(\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s)^m$, which means that
$\ap{\cdg{m}}\pathpair{\etop{s}}{!}$ is indeed the $m$-th power of the
loop of $(\bn m\times \zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{\etop{s}})$.

This will eventually be explained in terms of the symmetries of the
degree $m$ \covering of the circle being given by the powers of $\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s$ in a
nonunique fashion: for any $a:\zet$, the $a$-th and the $(a+m)$-th power of
$\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s$ give rise to the same symmetry, see \cref{sec:deckS1}.

Why does this correspond to the $m$-fold \covering we defined in \cref{exa:mfoldS1cover}?
This is encapsuled by the fact that under the equivalence $c:\Sc\to C$ the two $m$-fold covers agree in the sense that the two functions given as composites in
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \Sc\ar[r,"c"]\ar[d,"\dg{m}"'] & C\ar[d,"\cdg{m}"] \\
    \Sc\ar[r,"c"] & C
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
are equal; we need an element in
\[
  \cdg{m}c=_{\Sc\to C}c\,\dg{m}.
\]
Under the equivalence
\[
  \ev_C:(\Sc\to C)\we \sum_{(X,f):C}((X,f)=(X,f))
\]
of \cref{lem:freeloopspace},
the composite $c\,\dg{m}$ is given by $((\zet,s),s^m)$
and the composite $\cdg{m}c$ is given by
$((\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s),\id\times s)$: we must produce an element in
\[
  ((\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s),\id\times s)=((\zet,s),s^m).
\]
Consider the equivalence  $\varphi: (\bn m\times \zet)\to\zet$ with $\varphi(k,n)=k+mn$ discussed above.  Since transport of $\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s$ along $\varphi$ is exactly $s$ (\ie $\varphi\!\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s=s\varphi$;
note the way we formulate this so that we don't need to talk about the inverse of $\varphi$\footnote{%
  Of course, the inverse of $\varphi$ maps $z:\zet$ to the remainder and the integer quotient of $z$ under Euclidean division by $m$, cf.~\cref{lem:euclid-div}.})
we get an identification that we also call $\varphi:(\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s)=_C(\zet,s)$.  Likewise, transport of $\id\times s$ along $\varphi$ is $s^m$, so that $\varphi$ lifts to an element in
$((\bn m\times\zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s),\id\times s)=((\zet,s),s^m)$.
\end{example}

\begin{xca}\label{xca:pointed-maps-circle}
Verify $\cdg{m}c=_{\Sc\ptdto C}c\,\dg{m}$ in case all maps are taken to be pointed.
\end{xca}

There are many other instances of the $m$-th root construction, \cref{con:root},
which is of independent interest.
We record the following for future reference.
\begin{definition} \label{def:Zetmodm}
Let $m$ be a positive integer.
The element $\zet/m:\sum_{X:\Set}(X=X)$ has first projection $\bn m\times\bn 1$ and
second projection $\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{\refl{\bn 1}}$.
\end{definition}
\noindent
This realizes the cycle $0\mapsto1\mapsto\dots\mapsto m-1\mapsto 0$ in $\bn m$,
and so models ``modular arithmetic''.\footnote{%
  This definition is equivalent to the one from \cref{ft:infinite-cyclic-modulo},
  as the elements $0,\dots,m-1$ in $\bn m$ give a system of representatives
  for $\sim_m$.}

\begin{definition} \label{def:hatCovering}
For any type $B$, let $\hat B$ be the type of connected decidable \coverings over $B$.
\end{definition}

Thus $\hat C$ is the type of connected decidable \coverings over $C$.
It follows from \cref{lem:setbundle-is-groupoid} that $\hat C$,
being a subtype of $\SetBundle(C)$, is a groupoid.
Let $\hat C_0$ be the component of $C$ of the universal \covering
from \cref{exa:univCcover}. For any $m>0$, let $\hat C_m$ be the component of $C$
of the $m$-fold \covering from \cref{exa:mfoldCcover}.
We are interested in the structure of the connected components of $\hat C$.
Any (other) textbook will tell you that \cref{exa:univCcover} and \cref{exa:mfoldCcover}
are all the connected \coverings over
the circle (precisely one for each natural number), but the proof is unfortunately not constructive:
we need a further assumption, namely:

\begin{principle}[Limited Principle of Omniscience, LPO]
  \label{LPO}\index{LPO}
  Any function $P:\NN\to\bn 2$ is either constant $0$,
  or there is a smallest $n_0:\NN$ such that $P(n_0)=1$.
\end{principle}

Note that LPO is weaker than LEM (cf. \cref{pri:lem}), by which is meant the following.\footnote{%
  It is also the case that LPO does not imply LEM.}
\begin{lemma}
  LEM implies LPO.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Indeed, for any function $P:\NN \to \bn 2$, one can consider
  the type $\kappa_P\defequi\prod_{n:\NN}0=P(n)$. Because $\NN$ is a set, the type
  $\kappa_P$ is a proposition. Assuming LEM, either $\kappa_P$ or its negation
  $\kappa_P \to \false$ holds. If $\kappa_P$ holds, then $P$ is constant $0$.
  Otherwise $\kappa_P \to \false$ holds and then one can consider the proposition
  \begin{displaymath}
    \eta_P \defequi \exists_{n:\NN}\left( 1=P(n) \times \prod_{m:\NN}m<n \to 0 = P(m) \right).
  \end{displaymath}
  Because we assumed LEM, proving the proposition $\eta_P$ can be
  done by contradiction. Suppose $\eta_P \to \false$. To derive a
  contradiction, we simply show that $\kappa_P$ follows. This is done by proving
  $\forall_{m:\NN} m\leq n \to 0 = P(m)$ by induction on $n:\NN$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item for $n\jdeq 0$, the property simplifies to $0 = P(0)$; this holds by
      contradiction, as otherwise $1 = P(0)$ and it provides a element of
      $\eta_P$, leading to $\false$,
    \item assuming the property at rank $n:\NN$, it holds at rank $n+1$ by
      contradiction: indeed, otherwise, because all numbers $m<n$ satisfy $0 =
      P(m)$ by induction hypothesis, it means that $1=P(n)$, which gives an
      element of $\eta_P$, eventually leading to $\false$.
  \end{enumerate}
  In particular, we have proved $\kappa_P$, and because one has $\kappa_P \to
  \false$ among our hypothesis, one finds a contradiction.
\end{proof}

As for LEM, we are free to assume LPO or not, and we will be explicit about
where we will use it. LPO makes it possible to prove that the canonical map
$(\sum_{m:\NN} \hat C_m) \to \hat C$, mapping $(m,c,!)$ to $c$, is an
equivalence.  We will elaborate this equivalence in the next paragraphs.

Fix for the moment an element $(A,f,!)$ of $\hat C$, that is,
a connected type $A$ and a decidable \covering  $f:A\to C$ (see \cref{def:covering}).
Using LPO we can define the unique $m:\NN$ such that $(A,f,!)$ is in $\hat C_m$.
Since this goal is propositional, we may pick a point $\pt_A$ in
the non-empty type $A$. Then $f(\pt_A) : C$. Again, since $C$ is connected
and the goal is propositional, we may assume $p: f(\pt_A) = \pt_C$.

Define $g: (\pt_A=\pt_A)\to\zet$ as the following composite:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    (\pt_A=\pt_A)\ar[r,"\ap{f}"] &
    (f(\pt_A)=f(\pt_A))\ar[r,"\trp{p}"] &
    (\pt_C=\pt_C)\ar[r,"\ev_0\vphantom{\trp{p}}"] &
    \zet.
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
Here $\trp{p}$ and $\ev_0$ are equivalences, and $\ap{f}$ is injective
since $f$ is a \covering (use \cref{cor:fib-vs-path}\ref{set-fib-vs-path}).
Hence $\pt_A=\pt_A$ is equivalent to the image of $g$.
Since $f$ is a decidable \covering, we have that the preimages $g^{-1}(m)$
are decidable propositions. Note that $g^{-1}(0)$ is true since $g(\refl{})=0$.

Now apply LPO (\cref{LPO}) with $P(m)\defeq 1$ if $g^{-1}(m+1)$ and $P(m)\defeq 0$ otherwise.
We are then left with two cases.
One is that $P$ is constant $0$, so the image of $g$ consists of only $0$,
and $\pt_A=_A\pt_A$ is contractible. By \cref{xca:connected-trivia}
we get that $A$ is contractible, and hence $(A,f,!)$ is the universal \covering.

In the other case we get the smallest $n_0: \NN$ such that $g^{-1}(n_0 + 1)$.
This means that we get a $p_0:\pt_A=_A\pt_A$ with $m\defeq g(p_0)=n_0 +1$.
Furthermore, if $q:\pt_A=\pt_A$ is any element with $g(q)>0$, then  by Euclidean division of \cref{lem:euclid-div}, there exist $k,r:\NN$ with $r<m$ so that $g(q)=km+r$.  Now, the natural number $r$ is in the image of $g$ (because $r=g(q)-km=g(qp_0^{-k})$) and is less than the minimal positive value $m$ in the image of $g$, and so we must conclude that $r=0$. In other words, $g(q)$ is a multiple $km$.

Arguing similarly for the negative values $g(q)$, we reach the conclusion that the image of $g$ is $m\zet$.
The positive number $m$ is independent of the choice of $\pt_A :A$ and $p: f(\pt_A)=pt_C$ since
$A$ and $C$ are connected. Since $g$ is injective, we have the following
sequence of equivalences:
\[
(\pt_A=\pt_A)\quad \equiv \quad m\zet \quad\equiv\quad \zet\quad \equiv\quad (\base=_{\Sc}\base).
\]
The relevant trace is $p_0 \mapsto m \mapsto 1 \mapsto {\Sloop}$.
These equivalences satisfy the conditions of \cref{lem:S1-delooping},
and thus we get an equivalence $\check e: \Sc\equiv A$ with $\check e(\Sloop) = p_0$.

Finally, we show that $(C,\cdg{m},!) =_{\hat C} (A,f,!)$.
Consider the following diagram:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=huge]
    C\ar[ddr,"\cdg{m}"'] &
    \Sc \ar[d,"\dg{m}"']\ar[l,"c"',"\sim"]\ar[r,"\check e","\sim"'] &
    A\ar[ddl,"f"] \\
    & \Sc \ar[d,"c"',"{\text{\rotatebox[origin=c]{270}{$\sim$}}}"] & \\
    & \,C &
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
The left half commutes by \cref{exa:mfoldCcover}.
The right half also commutes, by circle induction:
in case of the base point $\base$ we use the assumption $p: f(\pt_A)=\pt_C$.
In the case of the loop $\Sloop$ we get $s^m = \trp{p}(f(p_0))$ since both
are mapped to $m$ by the equivalence $\ev_0$. Hence the whole diagram
commutes. Finally, applying UA to the equivalences $c$ and $\check e$,
we conclude $(C,\cdg{m},!) =_{\hat C} (A,f,!)$.

We summarize these results in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:componentsofcoversofS1}
Assuming LPO (\cref{LPO}), the type of connected decidable \coverings over the circle is the sum
of the component containing the universal \covering and for each positive integer $m$,
the component containing the $m$-fold \covering.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:flipthecircle}
The reader may wonder how the ``orientation reversing'' map $r:\Sc\to \Sc$ given
by $r(\base)=\base$ and $r(\Sloop)=\Sloop^{-1}$ fits into the picture.\footnote{%
  As an operation on infinite cyclic sets,
  $c r c^{-1} : C \to C$ maps $(X,i)$ to $(X,i^{-1})$,
  flipping the arrows.}
As connected decidable \coverings, we have
$(C,crc^{-1},!) =_{\hat C} (C,\id_C,!) =_{\hat C} (\Sc,c,!) =_{\hat C} (\Sc,cr,!)$.
These equalities follow from the diagrams:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
    C\ar[rr,eqr,"\scriptsize\overetop{crc^{-1}}"]\ar[dr,"crc^{-1}"'] && C\ar[dl,"\id_C"] &
    \Sc\ar[rr,eqr,"\etop{c}"]\ar[dr,"c"'] && C\ar[dl,"\id_C"] &
    \Sc\ar[rr,eqr,"\etop{r}"]\ar[dr,"cr"'] && \Sc\ar[dl,"c"] \\
    &\,C&&&\,C&&&\,C&
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
All three diagrams are special cases of the general case of an equivalence\marginnote{
  $\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small,ampersand replacement=\&]
    A\ar[rr,eqr,"\etop{e}"]\ar[dr,"fe"'] \& \& A'\ar[dl,"f"] \\
    \& \,C \&
  \end{tikzcd}$}
$e: A\to A'$ depicted in the diagram in the margin, implying $(A,fe,!)=(A',f,!)$.
The point is that the degree $m$ and degree $-m$ maps give the same \emph{bundles} (by composing with $r$), while as \emph{maps} they are different.

See the next section for more precise information on equality of \coverings.

\section{Symmetries of \coverings of the circle are ``cyclic'' }
\label{sec:deckS1}

% In this section we prove the following result.
The term ``cyclic'' in the chapter heading refers to the fact that we show
that the symmetries of \coverings are determined by iterations of a single symmetry.

\begin{remark}
Since we are interested in the symmetries of particular \coverings it is
good to spell out some details.
By \cref{lem:isEq-pair=} the identity type $(A,f,!)=(A',f',!)$ of
two \coverings over the type $B$ is equivalent to
\[
\sum_{p_A:A=_{\UU}A'}(\pathover{f}{X\mapsto(X\to B)}{p_A}{f'}).
\]
The latter type is by \cref{def:pathover-trp} and \cref{lem:trp-in-function-type}
with $X\jdeq\UU,~Y\jdeq\id_{\UU}$ and $Z$ constant $B$, and the remark

% We start by investigating the symmetries of the universal \covering of the circle,
% since this case is simpler than that of the $m$-fold \coverings.
% Some easy observations will pave the way.

% First, for any types $X,Y$
% define $C_{Y,X} : X\to (Y\to X)$ to map any $x:X$ to the map $Y\to X$
% that is constant $x$, that is, $C_{Y,X}(x)\defeq c_x$.
% %We may leave out the subscripts of the map $C$. (confusion with type C)
% Clearly, $C_{\bn{1},X}$ is an equivalence from $X$ to $\bn{1}\to X$,
% which induces an equivalence from $x=x$ to $C_{Y,X}(x) = C_{Y,X}(x)$
% for any $x:X$.

% Second, we have by UA that $\bn{1}=\bn{1}$ is contractible
% and mapping $e: f=g$ to $(\refl{\bn{1}},e)$ is a equivalence from
% $f=g$ to $\sum_{i:\bn{1}=\bn{1}} (\pathover{f}{\_\mapsto X}{i}{g})$
% for all $f,g:\bn{1}\to X$.

% Third, we have the equivalence from \cref{lem:isEq-pair=}.
% Combining these three equivalences in the special case of the point $\base:\Sc$ we get:
% \[
% (\base=\base) \equiv (c_\base=c_\base) \equiv
% \sum_{i:\bn{1}=\bn{1}} (\pathover{c_\base}{\_\mapsto \Sc}{i}{c_\base}) \equiv
% ((\bn{1},c_\base)=_{\hat\Sc}(\bn{1},c_\base)).
% \]
% The trace is $p \mapsto \ap{C_{\bn{1},X}}(p) \mapsto
% (\refl{\bn{1}},\ap{C_{\bn{1},X}}(p)) \mapsto \pathpair{\refl{\bn{1}}}{\ap{C_{\bn{1},X}}(p)}$.
% Applying this trace with $p\defeq\Sloop$ we obtain an additive unit for
% all these types that are equivalent to $\zet$.
Recall that for any type $X$ and element $x:X$, $\cst x$ denotes the
function $\bn 1\to X$ defined by $\cst x (\ast) \defequi x$ on the
unique element $\ast: \bn 1$. In particular,
$\cst \base : \bn 1 \to \Sc$ denotes the universal \covering of $\Sc$.

\begin{theorem}~%
  \label{thm:coveringsofS1}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{item:univ-cover-Sc-Z}%
    There is an equivalence
    $\Sc \weq \conncomp {\SetBundle(\Sc)} {\cst \base}$ mapping
    $\base$ to $(\cst \base, \trunc{\refl {\cst \base}})$.

    In particular, there is a symmetry
    \[
      Q^1:\cst\base=_{\SetBundle(\Sc)}\cst\base
    \]
    such that every symmetry of $\cst\base$
    (as a \covering over $\Sc$)
    writes as $(Q^1)^k$ for a unique $k:\zet$.

  \item \label{item:setbundle-mcover}%
    For a positive integer $m$, the set
    $\dg{m}=\dg{m}$ of symmetries of the
    $m$-fold \covering of the circle is equivalent to the finite type
    $\bn m$.

    Furthermore, there is a symmetry
    \begin{displaymath}
      Q^1:\dg{m}=_{\SetBundle(\Sc)}\dg{m}
    \end{displaymath}
    so that every symmetry of $\dg{m}$ (as set bundle over
    $\Sc$) writes as $(Q^1)^i$ for a uniquely determined $k$ between
    $0$ and $m-1$. In other words, following \cref{def:Zetmodm},
    \begin{displaymath}
      \conncomp{\SetBundle(\Sc)}{\dg{m}} \weq \conncomp{\left(\sum_{X:\Set}X=X\right)}{\zet/m}.
    \end{displaymath}

  \end{enumerate}
 \end{theorem}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:thenonuniquenessofgeneratorsofmodulararithmetic1}
  The symmetries called $Q^1$ in \cref{thm:coveringsofS1} are not
  uniquely determined by the stated property.  In the case of the
  universal \covering there are two candidates and for the $m$-fold
  \covering there are as many as there are positive integers less than
  $m$ that does not divide $m$.  This behavior has number theoretic
  consequences and origins and will be investigated further when we
  have the proper machinery to put it to good use.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  Let us first prove \ref{item:univ-cover-Sc-Z}. Through
  \cref{lem:S1-delooping}, it is enough to find an equivalence
  $(\base = \base) \weq (\cst\base =_{\SetBundle(\Sc)} \cst\base)$
  which preserves reflexivity and composition of paths. It is obtained
  as the composition
  \begin{displaymath}
    \left(\base =_{\Sc} \base\right) \weq \left( \cst\base=_{\bn 1\to \Sc}\cst\base \right)
    \weq \left( \cst\base =_{\SetBundle(\Sc)} \cst\base \right)
  \end{displaymath}
  where the first equivalence is given by induction on $\bn 1$ and
  function extensionality, and the second one is mapping a path $e$ to
  the path $(\refl{\bn 1}, e)$. Both equivalences clearly preserve
  reflexivity paths and composition of paths, hence so does their
  composition.

  Let us move on to \ref{item:setbundle-mcover}. %
  First, let us emphasize that we are interested in the symmetries of
  $\dg{m}$ \emph{as a set bundle}, meaning we shall explore
  the loops $(\Sc,\dg{m}) =_X (\Sc,\dg{m})$ in the type
  $\SetBundle(\Sc)$.
  Because $\SetBundle(\Sc)$ is a subtype of $\sum_{A:\UU}A\to \Sc$, it
  is enough to determine the symmetries of $(\Sc,\dg{m})$ in this later
  type (cf.\ \cref{lem:subtype-eq-=}). This is unfolded as:
  \begin{displaymath}
    D_m \defequi \sum_{g:\Sc = \Sc}\dg{m} =_{\Sc \to \Sc} \dg{m}\ptoe g
  \end{displaymath}
  Recall the equivalence $c: \Sc \to C$ of
  \cref{thm:S1bysymmetries}. Then the transport along $\etop c$ in the
  type family $X\mapsto (\Sc=X)$ is an equivalence from $(\Sc = \Sc)$
  to $(\Sc = C)$. Composing with univalence, we get that an
  equivalence $(\Sc=\Sc) \to (\Sc \weq C)$ mapping
  $g\mapsto c\ptoe{g}$, with inverse
  $t \mapsto \overetop{\inv{c} t}$.
  Hence, by following \cref{xca:sum-equiv-base} we get
  \begin{displaymath}
    D_m \weq  \sum_{t:\Sc \weq C} \dg{m} =_{\Sc\to \Sc} \dg{m}\inv c t.
  \end{displaymath}
  Then, denoting $\cdg{m}: C \to C$ for the $m$-fold cover of $C$,
  \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{split}
      (\dg{m} =_{\Sc\to \Sc} \dg{m}\inv c t) %
      &\weq (c \dg{m} =_{\Sc\to C} c \dg{m} \inv c t)
      \\
      &\weq (\cdg{m}c =_{\Sc\to C} \cdg{m}_C t)
    \end{split}
  \end{displaymath}
  where the first equivalence holds because $c$ is an equivalence, and
  the second because $\cdg{m}c =_{\Sc\to C} c \dg{m}$ has been
  proved in \cref{exa:mfoldCcover}.
  Then if we write
  \begin{displaymath}
    F_m \defequi \sum_{t:\Sc \weq C}(\cdg{m}c =_{\Sc\to C} \cdg{m} t),
  \end{displaymath}
  one gets that $D_m \weq F_m$ and we can now concentrate on proving that
  $F_m \weq \bn m$.

  Let us first sketch the proof in three steps:
  \begin{enumerate}[label={\sc Step \arabic*}.]
  \item We shall describe the elements of $F_m$ as basically tuples
    $(Y,g,q)$ with $(Y,g)$ in the subtype $C$ of $\sum_{X:\UU}(X=X)$
    and $q:\bn m\times \zet = \bn m\times Y$ such that $q$ satisfies
    certain propositional equations, denoted $E(q)$ here.
  \item We shall then give a characterization of these elements
    $(Y,g,q)$ in the case where $Y$ is $\zet$ and $g$ is $\etop
    s$. This characterization will give $q$ (viewed as an equivalence)
    the following form:
    \begin{displaymath}
      q_{i,n}: (j,z) \mapsto {\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s}^j(i,n+z)
    \end{displaymath}
    In particular, it can be seen that
    $(\zet,\etop s,q_{i,n}) = (\zet,\etop s,q_{i,0})$ in $F_m$.
  \item Finally we shall define a map $\psi: \bn m \to F_m$ properly
    as $i\mapsto (\zet,\etop s,q_{i,0})$ and prove that it is an
    equivalence. It means that given $(Y,g,!):C$, one has to show
    \begin{displaymath}
      P(Y,g) \defequi \prod_{q:\bn m \times \zet = \bn m \times Y}E(q)\to\iscontr(\inv{\psi}(Y,g,q))
    \end{displaymath}
    where $E(q)$ is as in step 1. The dependent product is valued in
    propositions so $P(Y,g)$ itself is a proposition. By definition of
    $C$, $(Y,g)$ lies in the same connected component as $(Z,\etop s)$
    in $\sum_{X:\UU}X=X$, so using \cref{xca:component-connected},
    $P(Y,g)$ holds as soon as $P(Z,\etop s)$ holds. Otherwise put, it
    is enough to prove the contractibility of the fiber of $\psi$ at
    elements of $F_m$ of the form $(Z,\etop s,q)$ for which step 2
    shows that $q$ must be one of the $q_{i,n}$ for some $(i,n)$. This
    $i$, together with the essentially unique proof that
    $(\zet,\etop s, q_{i,n}) = (\zet,\etop s, q_{i,0})$, is then
    easily seen to be a center of contraction for the fiber
    $\inv\psi(Z,\etop s, q)$.
  \end{enumerate}

  {\sc Step 1.} An element of $F_m$ is given by a map $t:\Sc \to C$
  together with a term $!:\isEq(t)$ and a proof
  $Q: \cdg{m}c = \cdg{m}t$. Now such a $t$ can be reduced through
  the universal property of $\Sc$ to the data of
  $t(\base)\defequi (Y,g,!)$ and
  $t(\Sloop)\defis (p,!,!): (Y,g,!) =_C (Y,g,!)$. Under identification
  through the universal property of $\Sc$, $\cdg{m}c$ is given by
  \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{split}
      &\cdg{m}c(\base) \defequi (\bn m\times \zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] {\etop s},!)\\
      &\cdg{m}c(\Sloop) \defis (\id \times {\etop s},!,!): (\bn
      m\times \zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] {\etop s},!) =_C (\bn m\times
      \zet,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] {\etop s},!)
    \end{split}
  \end{displaymath}
  and similarly $\cdg{m}t$ is given by
  \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{split}
      &\cdg{m}t(\base) \defequi (\bn m\times Y,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] g,!)\\
      &\cdg{m}t(\Sloop) \defis (\id \times p,!,!): (\bn m\times
      Y,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] g,!) =_C (\bn m\times Y,\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] g,!)
    \end{split}
  \end{displaymath}
  By function extensionality and $\Sc$-induction, $Q$ becomes then a
  term $q:\bn m\times \zet = \bn m\times Y$ such that the two
  following propositions hold, whose product is denoted $E(q)$:
  \begin{displaymath}
    {\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]g} \circ q = q \circ \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{\etop s}%
    \quad\text{and}\quad%
    q \circ (\id \times {\etop s}) = (\id \times p) \circ q.%
  \end{displaymath}
  Remark that repeated applications of the first equation imply that
  such a $q$ is completely determined by
  $\ptoe q (0,0): \bn m\times Y$: indeed for all $j\in\bn m$ and
  $z\in\zet$
  \begin{displaymath}
    \ptoe q (j,z) = \ptoe q ( \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s^{j+zm} (0,0))%
    = \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]g^{j+zm} \ptoe q(0,0)%
  \end{displaymath}
  Remark also for future references that the proposition $p=g$ holds:
  indeed,
  \begin{displaymath}
    \id \times p = q \circ (\id \times {\etop s}) \circ q^{-1}
    = (q\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]{\etop s}q^{-1})^m = (\sqrt[\uproot{2}m]g)^m = \id \times g.
  \end{displaymath}

  {\sc Step 2.} In particular, when $t$ is actually $c$, then $Y$ is $\zet$, and $g$
  and $p$ are both $\etop s$. Define then for each pair
  $(i,n)\in\bn m \times \zet$ a function
  $q_{i,n}:\bn m\times\zet \to \bn m\times\zet$ as follows:
  \begin{displaymath}
    (j,z) \mapsto \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s^{j+zm}(i,n)%
  \end{displaymath}
  Such a $q_{i,n}$ is an equivalence as it admits $q_{m-i,-n-1}$ as
  pseudo inverse. Moreover direct computations show easily that the
  propositions $\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] s q_{i,n} = q_{i,n}\sqrt[\uproot{2}m] s$ and
  $q_{i,n} \circ (\id \times s) = (\id \times s) \circ q_{i,n}$ are
  satisfied. In other words, for each $(i,n):\bn m \times \zet$,
  $(\zet,\etop s,!)$ together with $q_{i,n}$ yields, by the universal
  property of $\Sc$, an element $(c,!,Q_{i,n})$ of $F_m$, and the
  analysis of step 1 ensures that they are the only ones.

  {\sc Step 3.} Let us then define $\psi: \bn m \to F_m$ by mapping
  $i \mapsto (c,!,Q_{i,0})$. The claim is that $\psi$ is an
  equivalence. Recall that $\Sc \equiv C$ is a subtype of $\Sc \to C$,
  so that $F_m$ is a subtype of
  \begin{displaymath}
    \casoverline {F_m} \defequi \sum_{t:\Sc \to C}\cdg{m}c=_{\Sc\to C}\cdg{m}t
  \end{displaymath}
  If one denotes $\iota$ for the canonical inclusion
  $F_m\mono \casoverline{F_m}$, then the contractibility of the fiber of
  $\psi$ at a point $(t,!,Q):F_m$, is equivalent to the
  contractibility of the fiber of $\iota\circ\psi$ at
  $(t,Q):\casoverline{F_m}$ (by \cref{lem:subtype-eq-=}).  In other
  words, one need to provide, for every $t:\Sc \to C$, an element of:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \prod_{Q:(\cdg{m}c=\cdg{m}t)} \iscontr(\inv {(\iota \psi)} (t,Q))
  \end{displaymath}
  Taking advantage of the equivalence
  $\ev_C: (\Sc \to C) \weq \sum_{x:C}(x=_Cx)$ once again, this is
  equivalent as to provide, for every $x:C$, an element of:
  \begin{displaymath}
    P(x) \defequi \prod_{p:x=_Cx}
    \left(
      \prod_{Q:(\cdg{m}c=\cdg{m}\ve_C(x,p))} \iscontr(\inv {(\iota \psi)} (\ve_C(x,p),Q))
    \right)
  \end{displaymath}
  Because $\iscontr(\blank)$ is valued in propositions, then so is
  $P$. Through \cref{xca:component-connected} and because $C$ is
  connected, one needs to check $P$ on only one point. We choose to do
  so on $\pt_C$. Now, given $p:\pt_C = \pt_C$ and
  $Q:(\cdg{m}c=\cdg{m}\ve(\pt_c,p))$, step 1 proves that
  $(\etop s, !,!)=p$, so that in particular one has
  $\pi:c=\ve(\pt_C,p)$, and then step 2 ensures that $Q_{i,n}=_\pi Q$
  for some $(i,n):\bn m \times \zet$. Also notice that if one denotes
  $\sigma_n:c = c$ for the path induced by $(\etop s^n,!,!): \pt_C=\pt_C$,
  then it holds that $Q_{i,0}=_{\sigma_n}Q_{i,n}$: indeed the
  transport along $\etop s^n$ (in the type family
  $X \mapsto (\bn m\times \zet = \bn m\times X)$) is just the
  postcomposition with $\id \times \etop s^n$, and
  \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{split}
      (\id\times s^n) q_{i,0} = \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s^{nm}q_{i,0} &= ((j,z)\mapsto \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s^{nm+j+zm}(i,0))\\
      &= ((j,z)\mapsto \sqrt[\uproot{2}m]s^{j+zm}(i,n)) \\
      &= q_{i,n}
    \end{split}
  \end{displaymath}
  The compositions of the paths described above yield a path
  $\pi\sigma_n: c = \ve_C(\pt_C,p)$ and a path-over
  $Q_{i,0} =_{\pi\sigma_n} Q$, so that $(i,(\pi\sigma_n,!))$ is in the
  fiber of $\iota\psi$ at $\ve_C(\pt_C,p)$. We claim it is a center of
  contraction. Indeed, for any other $j:\bn m$ together with a path
  $\rho:c=\ve_C(\pt_C,p)$ such that $Q_{j,0}=_\rho Q$, one gets
  $Q_{i,0}=_{\inv \rho \pi\sigma_n}Q_{j,0}$. \cref{lem:IdCisZet} show
  that $\inv\rho\pi\sigma_n = \sigma_k$ for some $k:\zet$ and the
  previous path-over between $Q_{i,0}$ and $Q_{j,0}$ then means that
  $(\id \times s^k)q_{i,0}=q_{j,0}$ which evaluated at
  $(0,0):\bn m\times Z$ gives the equations $i=j$ and $k=0$. Hence
  $(j,(\rho,!)) = (i,(\pi\sigma_n,!))$, concluding thus the proof that
  $(i,(\pi\sigma_n,!))$ is a center of contraction for the fiber at
  play.

  \end{proof}

  \begin{remark}
    Regarding the symmetries of the $m$-fold \covering of the circle, recall the picture we tried to evoke in \cref{rem:finitecoveringsofS1}.  How can I move my circle with $m$ evenly spaced marked points  (which we now call $0,1,\dots, m-1$ instead of $1,2,\dots 12$ since it fits better with future applications) without disturbing the projection down to the circle (sending all the marked points to $0$).  I can move the marked points, but a marked point has to be sent to a marked point (otherwise the projection down to the circle would be disturbed).  Let's say that mark $0$ is sent to mark $4$.  However, since we have to preserve the projection down to the circle, the arc from $0$ to $1$ must then be sent to the arc from $4$ to $5$.  Continuing in this fashion, we see that we describe a certain rotation of the circle.  Varying $4$ between $0$ and $m-1$ we see that there are exactly $m$ different symmetries of the $m$-fold \covering.  Furthemore they are all rotations of the circle by an angle which is a multiple of $2\pi/m$.
  \end{remark}


\subsection*{Alternative proof of \cref{thm:coveringsofS1}\ref{item:setbundle-mcover}}

In this subsection we present yet another proof, one that is not using the type $C$.
This proof uses some properties of $\Sc$ that are interesting in their own right.
We introduce them in the form of exercises.

\begin{xca}\label{xca:S1=S1-components}
Let $-\id_\Sc : \Sc\to\Sc$ be defined by $-\id_\Sc(\base)\defeq\base$
and $-\id_\Sc(\Sloop)\defis{\Sloop}^{-1}$. Show $-\id_\Sc \neq \id_\Sc$.
Prove the following proposition:
\[
\prod_{t:\Sc\equiv\Sc}{\Trunc{\id_\Sc = t}\amalg \Trunc{-\id_\Sc = t}}.\qedhere
\]
\end{xca}

\begin{xca}\label{xca:(S1->S1)_(f)-eqv-S1}
For any $f: \Sc\to\Sc$, give an equivalence
from $\Sc$ to $(\Sc\to\Sc)_{(f)}$, that is, from $\Sc$ to
the component of $\Sc\to\Sc$ at $f$.
Hint: use \cref{lem:S1-delooping}.
\end{xca}

We note in passing that combining the above two exercises
yields $(\Sc=\Sc)\equiv(\Sc\amalg\Sc)$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm:coveringsofS1}\ref{item:setbundle-mcover}]
  Let $m>0$ and
  \[
    D_m\defequi\sum_{t:\Sc\equiv\Sc} \dg{m} =_{\Sc\to\Sc} \dg{m} t.
  \]
Define
\[
f: \bn{m} \to D_m: k \mapsto (\id_\Sc,{\Sloop}^k)\quad\text{for all $k=0,\ldots,m-1$}.
\]
The above definition of $f$ is simplified in that we mean $\id_\Sc$
as an equivalence. Moreover, the type $\dg{m} =_{\Sc\to\Sc} \dg{m} \id_\Sc$ is equivalent,
by function extensionality and the universal property of the circle for
the type family $T(x)\defeq (\dg{m}(x) = \dg{m}(x))$, to the type
$\sum_{p: \base=\base} (\Sloop^m p = p \Sloop^m)$.
The latter type is equivalent to $\base=\base$ (use \cref{xca:commutative-add-Z}), and therefore
we can give any element of $\dg{m} =_{\Sc\to\Sc} \dg{m} \id_\Sc$ as $\Sloop^z$ for some $z:\zet$.
Finally, we tacitly coerce any element $k:\bn{m}$ to $k:\zet$.
We will frequently use such simplifications in the sequel.

Claim: the map $f$ is an equivalence, that is,
for all $t:\Sc\equiv\Sc$ and $Q : \dg{m} =_{\Sc\to\Sc} \dg{m} t$ we have
\[
\iscontr\Bigl(\sum_{k:\bn{m}} (t,Q) = f(k)\Bigr).
\]
This claim is a proposition.
In view of \cref{xca:S1=S1-components} it suffices to prove the claim
for $t\jdeq\id_\Sc$ and for $t\jdeq -\id_\Sc$. The latter case can be discarded
since $\dg{m} \neq \dg{m} (-\id_\Sc)$
(similar to $\id_\Sc \neq -\id_\Sc$ in \cref{xca:S1=S1-components}).
In the remaining paragraphs we deal with the case $t\jdeq\id_\Sc$.
We will use the equivalence $w: (\base=\base)\to\zet$ that
is the inverse of ${\Sloop}^{\blank}$ from \cref{cor:S1groupoid}.

Consider a $Q: \dg{m} =_{\Sc\to\Sc} \dg{m}$; then we have $Q(\base): \base=\base$,
and $Q(\Sloop)$ proves a proposition.
We have to propose a center of $\sum_{k:\bn{m}} (\id_\Sc,Q) = f(k)$,
and prove that it is a center of contraction.

For the center, we apply Euclidean Division, \cref{lem:euclid-div}, albeit for integers.
Write $w(Q(\base)) = ml+k$ with $k:\bn{m}$ and $l:\zet$, both unique.
We take $k$ as the first component of the center.
For the second component of the center it suffices to give an element of
$(\id_\Sc,Q(\base))=(\id_\Sc,{\Sloop}^k)\jdeq f(k)$.
We take ${\Sloop}^{-l}$ as (simplified) element of $\id_\Sc = \id_\Sc$.
The picture in \cref{fig:transport-R} depicts transport in the family $R(t)\defeq(\dg{m} = \dg{m} t)$
(top half) and specialize to the situation at hand (bottom half).
\begin{marginfigure}
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
      t\ar[d,eqr,"p"]
      \& \dg{m}\ar[r,eqr,"X"]
      \& \dg{m}t \ar[d,eqr,"(\dg{m}\blank)(p)"] \\
      t' \& \& \dg{m} t' %
      \\
      \id_\Sc\ar[d,eqr,"{\Sloop}^{-l}"]
      \& \base\ar[r,eqr,"Q(\base)"]
      \& \base\ar[d,eqr,"{\Sloop}^{-ml}"]
      \\
      \id_\Sc \& \& \base\vphantom{t}%
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  \caption{Transport in the type family $R$.}%
  \label{fig:transport-R}%
\end{marginfigure}
Clearly, the transport of $Q(\base)$ along ${\Sloop}^{-l}$ is
equal to ${\Sloop}^{k}$ because of $w(Q(\base)) = ml+k$.
This completes the construction of the center.

The last step is to show that the center is indeed a center of contraction.
Let $p': (\id_\Sc,Q(\base))=(\id_\Sc,{\Sloop}^{k'})\jdeq f(k')$ for $k':\bn{m}$.
Then $\fst(p') = {\Sloop}^{-l'}$ for some $l':\zet$. By exactly
the same analysis as above we get $w(Q(\base)) = ml'+k'$. Since Euclidean Division
is unique, we get $k'=k$ and $l'=l$. The type of $\snd(p')$ is a proposition.
Hence the pair $(k',p')$ is equal to the center.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Yet another proof of \cref{thm:coveringsofS1}\ref{item:setbundle-mcover}}

Recall what we want to achieve: A pointed equivalence between the component
$B_m \defeq \conncomp {\SetBundle(\Sc)} {\dg{m}}$ of set bundles over the circle
with fiber an $m$-element set, and the type $C_m$, itself the
connected component $\conncomp {\sum_{X:\UU}X=X} {(\bn m,s)}$ consisting
of $m$-element cyclic sets.
Furthermore, we'd like to prove that the loop types are themselves $m$-element sets,
\[
  \bigl(\dg{m} =_{\SetBundle(\Sc)} \dg{m}\bigr)
  \equiv
  \bigl((\bn m,s) =_{C_m} (\bn m,s)\bigr)
  \equiv
  \bn m,
\]
such that reflexivity corresponds to $0:\bn m$ and addition to concatenation.

In this proof, we use the characterization of set bundles as bundles of sets,
\ie $\SetBundle(\Sc) \equiv \Sc \to \Set$.
\begin{theorem}
  The map $F : C_m \to (\Sc \to \Set)$ defined by
  $F(X,i) \defeq \ve_\Set(X,i)$ induces an equivalence $C_m \equiv B_m$,
  whose inverse is given by taking the fiber at $\base$ with the identity obtained by transporting along $\Sloop$.
\end{theorem}
This is more or less the universal property of the circle,
which gives the equivalence $\ev_\Set : (\Sc \to \Set) \equiv \sum_{X:\Set}(X=X)$.
We just have to check that $\ev_\Set$ and $\ve_\Set$ preserve the components,
which they do.

\begin{theorem}
  The iteration map $\etop s^- : \zet \to (\bn m,\etop s)=(\bn m,\etop s)$
  induces an equivalence $\bn m \equiv \zet/m \equiv (\bn m,\etop s)=(\bn m,\etop s)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The map sends $k:\zet$ to the identification that maps $0:\bn m$ to $(k\pmod m) : \bn m$. This is the reflexivity iff $k=0 \pmod m$.
  Any identification $\pathpair{\etop g}{!} : (\bn m,\etop s)=(\bn m,\etop s)$
  is uniquely determined by $g(0)$.
\end{proof}
General proof that the bundle automorphisms of a connected circle bundle
is determined by the image of a point.
\begin{theorem}
  Suppose $(X,i)$ is a connected circle bundle with a chosen point $x_0:X$.
  Then evaluation at $x_0$ determines an equivalence
  $\bigl((X,i) = (X,i)\bigr) \equiv X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Any $x:X$ determines a unique bundle map $g:\zet \to X$ sending $0$ to $x$.
  $g^{-1}(x_0)$ is either $\set{0}$ or of the form $\setof{km}{k:\zet}$ for some $m>0$. (LPO: similar proof as above?)

  Ideally, we want a constructive proof! Want a commuting diagram
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      & \bn 1 \ar[dl,"x_0"']\ar[dr,"x"] &\\
      A \ar[rr,dashed]\ar[dr] && A\ar[dl] \\
      & \Sc &
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  where $A \defeq \sum_{z:\Sc}\ve_\UU(X,i)(z)$.

  The fiber at $x$ is $\sum_{j : X=X}(ji=ij \times x=j(x_0))$.

\end{proof}
